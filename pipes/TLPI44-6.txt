One possible solution would be to set a timer on the open() of the client FIFO using
alarm(), as described in Section 23.3. This solution suffers from the drawback that
the server would still be delayed for the period of the timeout. Another possible
solution would be to open the client FIFO using the O_NONBLOCK flag. If this fails,
then the server can assume a misbehaving client. This latter solution also requires
changes to the client, which needs to ensure that it opens its FIFO (also using the
O_NONBLOCK flag) prior to sending a request to the server. For convenience, the client
should then turn off the O_NONBLOCK flag for the FIFO file descriptor, so that the
subsequent read() call blocks. Finally, it is possible to implement a concurrent
server solution for this application, with the main server process creating a child to
send the response message to each client. (This would represent a rather resource-
expensive solution in the case of this simple application.)
Other conditions that are not handled by this server remain. For example, it
doesn’t handle the possibilities of the sequence number overflowing or a misbehaving
client requesting large groups of sequence numbers in order to produce such over-
flows. The server also does not handle the possibility that the client specifies a negative
value for the sequence length. Furthermore, a malicious client could create its
reply FIFO, and then open the FIFO for reading and writing, and fill it with data
before sending a request to the server; as a consequence, the server would be able
to successfully open the reply FIFO, but would block when it tries to write the
reply. As a further exercise, you could try to devise strategies for dealing with these
possibilities.
In Section 44.8, we also noted another limitation that applies to the server in
Listing 44-7: if a client sends a message that contains the wrong number of bytes,
then the server will be out of step when reading all subsequent client messages.
One simple way to deal with this problem is to discard the use of fixed-length mes-
sages in favor of the use of a delimiter character.
